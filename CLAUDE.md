# Zotero-NSAI Project

## Project Overview

This is the zotero-nsai project, which appears to be an integration between Zotero (reference management software) and AI capabilities (NSAI).

## Project Structure

This is a new repository. The project structure will be established as development progresses.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

(To be determined based on technology stack)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd zotero-nsai

# Installation steps to be added
```

### Running the Project

```bash
# Commands to be added as the project develops
```

## Key Technologies

(To be documented as technology choices are made)

## Architecture

(Architecture documentation to be added)

## Important Files and Directories

(To be documented as project structure is established)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow consistent code formatting
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before committing

### Git Workflow

- Development branch: `claude/create-claude-md-0173ijqZdQbHT7i9X3sHRmPJ`
- Create feature branches from main development branch
- Use descriptive branch names
- Write clear commit messages

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features

1. Create a feature branch
2. Implement the feature
3. Write tests
4. Submit for review

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test commands to be added
```

### Building

```bash
# Build commands to be added
```

## Troubleshooting

(Common issues and solutions to be documented)

## Additional Resources

- [Zotero Documentation](https://www.zotero.org/support/)
- Project-specific documentation to be added

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an early-stage project
- Project structure and architecture decisions should be discussed before implementation
- Follow best practices for the chosen technology stack
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns as they emerge
- Always run tests before committing changes
- Document new features and architectural decisions
